    "title": "About RPJ AI",
    "backToChat": "Back to chat",
    "loading": "Loading...",
    "section1Title": "Who is RPJ AI for?",
    "section1Content": "For all pastoral leaders of the ecclesiastical institutions that participate in and make possible the Youth Pastoral Network RPJ. For catechists, animators, pastoral agents and companions of adolescents and young people in communities, youth groups, parishes or movements who want to improve their pastoral tools and resources. For other people interested in taking advantage of the possibilities offered by an AI specialized in youth ministry to help prepare evangelization initiatives.",
    "section2Title": "Why was RPJ AI created?",
    "section2Content1": "The digital continent and Artificial Intelligence are realities of contemporary culture that we can leverage in service of evangelization and the common good. Based on this objective, this tool is designed to complement and improve accessibility to resources that a companion of adolescents and young people may need in their pastoral mission from three principles of responsibility in its design and use that give it added value over other artificial intelligences.",
    "section2List1": "Ensure the reliability of the sources that RPJ AI primarily consults. The documents, materials and websites it uses as main reference have the credibility and backing of RPJ for having current, solid and pastorally truthful content.",
    "section2List2": "Use a quality pastoral pedagogy that RPJ AI has learned through specific instructions that RPJ pastoral specialists have incorporated into the system with an integral educational and catechetical approach to faith accompaniment.",
    "section2List3": "Safeguard the dignity and fundamental rights of the people who use it, avoiding any misinformation, privacy violations, commercial use of user data or the filtering of ideologically biased algorithms that are not transparent and respectful of fundamental rights and Church doctrine.",
    "section2Content2": "In light of essential documents such as, for example, Pope Francis's Apostolic Exhortation \"Christus vivit\" on youth ministry in 2019 or \"Antiqua et nova\" from the Dicasteries for the Doctrine of the Faith and for Culture and Education of the Holy See on Artificial Intelligence in 2025, and leveraging the good practices of the institutions that collaborate in the Youth Pastoral Network RPJ, this AI aims to help any pastoral agent to develop and customize activities, dynamics, prayers, celebrations, reflections and youth ministry programs according to their reality and pastoral context, emphasizing the importance of always using it with critical thinking and the criteria of the Church's teachings.",
    "section3Title": "How was RPJ AI created?",
    "section3Content1": "At RPJ, as part of the Church, we understand Artificial Intelligence as a limited framework of computational logic and data analysis that does not replace, under any circumstances, the physical, emotional, relational and spiritual dimension of human beings, their discernment and their interactions for the proper development and integral accompaniment of people.",
    "section3Content2": "From this perspective, this application that uses agentic Artificial Intelligence language models specialized in youth ministry has been built with a process of compiling official reference documents on youth ministry prepared by the Church (the Holy See and Episcopal Conferences) and resources and materials from the ecclesiastical institutions that participate in RPJ that have given permission with a proven track record in youth ministry from their different charisms. We highlight as an example, in this sense, the RPJ magazines (only since 2020 to ensure their currency) that have been incorporated as monographs on various topics of youth ministry.",
    "section3Content3": "At the same time, the RPJ teams have developed instructions (system prompts) that interpret instructions and incorporate pastoral learnings that serve to generate appropriate responses to each request, giving RPJ AI the role of an experienced youth pastoral agent who knows different resources for working with today's young people.",
    "section3Content4": "",
    "section4Title": "How to use RPJ AI?",
    "section4Content1": "We believe it will only be a useful tool in service of ministry if it is used by youth companions with gospel criteria from received training, practical experience and a defined reference youth ministry plan with its principles, dimensions, stages and objectives that guide and adapt the responses offered by RPJ AI.",
    "section4Content2": "The responses offered by RPJ AI will be more appropriate the more explicit and better explained the request is (pastoral context, specific task requested, characteristics of the adolescent or young people recipients, objectives of the proposal, format needed in the response with some example…)",
    "section4Content3": "RPJ AI has the ability to select what type of request you need as a youth pastoral agent (dynamics, prayers, celebrations…), the option to attach files for summary, learning or task based on the file, the Deep think model option to delve deeper into a topic, tool options such as voice dictation in conversations and downloading responses in a PDF or Word file.",
    "section4Content4": "In the Document Guide you can consult the files that RPJ AI uses as reference, knowing that its responses are also based on searches on reliable websites, the system instructions we have incorporated, and its own learning processes. RPJ AI has a limited number of conversations and messages per day for each person with the ability to speak in multiple languages (and change the interface language in Settings), and a contact email for any inquiries to the RPJ teams.",
    "section5Title": "Who is the Youth Pastoral Network RPJ?",
    "section5Content1": "We are a Catholic network of ecclesial and synodal collaboration committed to evangelization and accompaniment of youth pastoral agents. Since our foundation in 1959 by the Piarist Order with the youth pastoral magazine, we have been responding to the needs of the pastoral processes of each generation while maintaining the essence of service to the Church by providing reflections, training and the creation of pastoral resources and experiences with and for young people.",
    "section5Content2": "Since 2020 we have started working much more internationally, with online training and digital evangelization initiatives on social networks. Our teams and proposals include different ecclesiastical institutions from various countries, charisms and vocations that share this mission in Spanish and also in English.",
    "section5Institutions": "What institutions are part of RPJ:",
    "section5Teams": "Learn more about our teams and proposals:",
    "section5Content3": "RPJ wants to be an open, non-profit network sustained mainly by volunteer work. All our actions promote youth ministry accompanied by a reference Christian community that is the culmination of an itinerary prepared by well-trained catechist teams, from a serious pastoral project with principles and criteria reflected upon in the light of the gospel. Our pastoral proposal seeks to develop personal processes in groups and community in which young people discover the vocation that God dreams for them through comprehensive formation, with experiences of interiority and discernment, service to others, especially those who suffer most, and participation in the Church from a mature and joyful spirituality based on personal encounter with God, a coherent lifestyle and commitment to the world."
